# Smile Recognition Using Python
I used Raspberry Pi and Python to create a smile recognition program. The program uses 400 different smiling and unsmiling faces in a dataset as reference.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I set up the parts needed for the Raspberry Pi to run the smile recognition. I connected a LCD screen to the development board for the Raspberry Pi Desktop, which made it possible to control the Pi graphically. I also connected a small camera to the Raspberry Pi. As for the code, it worked reasonably well. I just need to debug some of it.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to familiarize myself with Python by creating a tic tac toe game. The game can be played by two players and use user inputs in the form of either the numbers 1 or 2 that I set up in the code. The user can also define the size of the tic tac toe game they wish to play. As of my code, I used numerous for and if loops to set the winning conditions and some while loops with if-else conditions to restart the game after a round is finished.
