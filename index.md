# Smile Recognition Using Python
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I set up the parts needed for the Raspberry Pi to run the smile recognition.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to familiarize myself with Python by creating a tic tac toe game. The game can be played by two players and use user inputs in the form of either the numbers 1 or 2 that I set up in the code. The user can also define the size of the tic tac toe game they wish to play. As of my code, I used numerous for and if loops to set the winning conditions and some while loops with if-else conditions to restart the game after a round is finished.
